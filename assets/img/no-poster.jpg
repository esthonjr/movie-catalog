This file should be a JPG image to be used when a movie doesn't have an available poster.

Since we cannot create binary files directly, you should replace this file with a real image.

Suggestion: Create a simple image with the text "No Poster Available" on a gray background.
Recommended dimensions: 500x750 pixels (typical movie poster ratio).
